## Introduction
A simple telegram bot can be built by writing some simple codes. Telegram bot API makes the development 
of telegram bots easy with a few of programming languages. For instance, there are some programming languages
being used in developing telegram bot such as Node. js, Java, Python, Rust as well as Elixir. In this assignment, 
Java is being used in the development of telegram bot. It is a widely used language in chat-bot projects development.
This is because Java has general purpose. It is also a platform-independent and portable language as well as it 
always implement object-oriented concepts.

Telegram bot can be created on the application Telegram, however, to make it have more functionality, Java is one of 
the best programming language to create it. It can also be connected to the database through SQLite to save and retrieve
the data.
